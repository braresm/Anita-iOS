Started by brothers Hub and Wim Van Doorne in a small blacksmith's shop, the company – short for Van Doorne's Aanhangwagen Fabriek – started off making simple engineering products, gradually progressing from trailers to cars and trucks. One of the most popular museums in the southern Netherlands, the DAF Museum is a testament to the company's success and includes a replica of the original workshops and offices, along with samples of its vehicles throughout the decades, including a number of prototypes. A shop and restaurant are located on the premises.",

            description: "Attractive St. Catherine's Church (St. Catharinakerk) was built in Neo-Gothic style in 1867. The original building – dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria – was consecrated in the 13th century and was many times severely damaged by war and fire, even spending part of the 18th-century as a stables and weapons store. Now fully restored, the current structure incorporates a number of symbolic references to the work of Joseph Thijm, one of the country's best-known writers. Highlights include its twin French Gothic towers, each 73 meters tall and known respectively as David and Maria. Interior highlights include its stained-glass windows and its two organs, one of them with 5,723 pipes.",
